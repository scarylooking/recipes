# Simple Cheese Sauce

Never stop stirring. Endless stirring. Inexorable stirring. If you stop stirring your sauce _will_ burn and it's a m'fucker to clean. Use a wooden spoon and make sure you get into the corners of the saucepan and really give it some.

The flour and butter paste is called a [roux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roux). You can use roux for thickening sauces, or for tonnes of other things. It's a really useful skill to have. In this recipe you're making a white roux.

Use pre-grated cheese if you have to, but bear in mind that...

1. This is lazy af.
2. Pre-grated cheese is usually junk.
3. It coated in starch to stop it sticking together which will make your sauce thicker when it cooks.

It's fine too cook this, then re-heat it later. Just make sure it doesn't burn while sitting.
