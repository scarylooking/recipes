# Simple Cheese Sauce

Never stop whisking. Endless whisking. Inexorable whisking. If you stop whisking your sauce _will_ burn and it's a m'fucker to clean.

You can use a wooden spoon instead of a whisk, just make sure you get into the corners of the saucepan and really give it some.

The flour and butter paste is called a [roux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roux). You can use roux for thickening sauces, or for tonnes of other things. It's a really useful skill to have. In this recipe you're making a white roux.

Use pre-grated cheese if you have to, but bear in mind that...

1. This is lazy af.
2. Pre-grated cheese is usually junk.
3. It coated in starch to stop it sticking together which will make your sauce thicker when it cooks.
