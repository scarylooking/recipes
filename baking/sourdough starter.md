### The first few days

For the first two days the starter should be fed every ~12 hours. There should be small bubbles on the surface by day two.

Filtered water that is free from (or low in) chlorine and chloramine gives far better results than treated tap water, especially early on.

### Day three and onwards

After day 2 the starter needs to be fed at least once per day, but better results can be achived by checking it every 12 hours and feeding it if a layer of yellow liquid has started to form.

As the starter gets thicker larger bubbles will form that should be visible through the glass and the starter will visibly grow over the course of a few hours after feeding.

### Maintanance and storage

After day 7 the starter can either be kept at room temperature and fed at least once per day, or it can be kept in the fridge and fed every ~5 days.

Before baking with a starter that has been kept in the fridge it needs to be fed and given ~12 hours to perk up or the loaf will fail to rise sufficiently.
