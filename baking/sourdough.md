## Ingredients

- 375g strong flour
- 160g active sourdough starter
- 220ml water
- 10g salt

## Equipment

- 1 wooden spoon
- 1 dough scraper
- 1 measuring jug
- 1 large mixing bowl
- 1 shaping basket
- 1 wire rack
- 1 baking tray
- 1 roasting tin
- 1 tea towel

## Preparation

## Method

### Make the dough

- Fold together the flour, salt, water, and starter in the mixing bowl with the dough scraper until it forms a very loose dough.
- Dump the dough out on the countertop.
- Using alternaing hands knead the dough by pushing it along the counter with the heel of your hand then hook the edge of the dough and pull it back.
- Keep kneading until you can get a gluten window to form.
- Put the dough back into the mixing bowl and cover with a tea towel.
- Let the dough rise at room temperature for at least 3 hours.

### Knock it back

- Flour the shaping basket.
- Dump the dough out onto the countertop.
- Flatten the dough out then fold the edges back into the center, rotate, and repeat a few times.
- Turn the dough over and drag it across the counter to add surface tension and shape it.
- Place the dough upside down in the shaping basket.
- Let the dough raise for at least 3 hours, or overnight in the fridge.

### Bake

- If the dough is in the fridge take it out and let it warm up for ~60 minutes at room temperature.
- Prod the dough to make sure it has risen fully. It should spring back a little, but not all the way.
- Set the oven to at least 230Â°C.
- Place a roasting tin in the bottom of the oven, and a baking tray in the middle of the oven then leave it to heat up. Boil the kettle.
- When the oven is at the right temperature take the baking tray out and turn the bread out onto it from the shaping basket.
- Score the surface of the bread with a sharp knife to let it open up as it bakes.
- Pour a mug of hot water into the roasting tin, and place the bread in the oven on the baking tray.
Bake for ~35 minutes until the crust is a deep golden brown and the loaf makes a hollow sound when tapped.
- Take the bread out of the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for ~ 15 minutes before cutting into it.
