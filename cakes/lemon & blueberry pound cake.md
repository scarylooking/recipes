# Lemon & Blueberry Pound Cake

Makes ~9 slices

To make a light fluffy sponge you would fold the ingredients together but this is intended to be much denser and heavier, so you'll need to beat them together.

When you mix the lemon into the milk it will curdle. In most situations ths is a bad thing, but in the context of this recipie it's fine.

If you want to add more blueberries that's fine but you might find that the cake breaks up more easily, especially if you are using a wider cake tin. It may be better to bake it in a loaf tin instead if you want a fuckload of blueberries.

When you're making the icing it needs to be thicker than you think, or else it will just run off the sides. If you're using a loaf tin you'll only need about half the amount of icing.

Anyone who tells you that you _need_ a mixer to cream butter and sugar can fuck off. A bowl, a spoon, and some moral fortitude is all you need.
